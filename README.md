# ToDoList
This is a Python ToDo List. It is a command-line app.
I have added many functionalities to this application such as,
1) Adding the task
2) Deletion of a task
3) Editing a task
4) SQL integration to store the data in the app consistently
5) Added functionality to output the ToDo List to a local notepad file, so that we don't have to run the Pycharm app for a long time.
6) It has been optimized to catch and successfully handle various exceptions.
